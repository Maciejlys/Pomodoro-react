# What was used in this project?

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [react-countdown-circle-timer](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer)

this was also my first time using [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
and it took me a while to get used to it as int the past I was using Context Api for\
state management because all of my projects were really small and simple.
Although, this is also very small project, I tried to learn it a bit\
so I can use it in near future more effectivly.

# What would I change?

I think I learned alot while doing this projcet, and thats why \
if I had to redo it I would definitely make sure to reuse more components\
I would also make sure that routing is done better from the beginning\
so I don't have to fix it at the end for few hours.

# Testing

If you wish to test this app, after logging in, press the right top corner to enter\
debug mode. This changes work time from 25 min to 2 seconds so that you can see all\
this app has to offer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
